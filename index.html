            <p>Hi! I’m glad you’re here. If you stumbled in by accident...willkommen, bienvenue, welcome</p>
            
            <p>I’m Jasmin, Jazz if you ask my friends who have forgotten my real name, Spasmin if you ask my dad, Jazzmo to my brother, most beautiful and talented darling daughter to my mother, and "the creature" to my partner or anyone who's seen me in the sea.</p>

            <p>This is my little organised chaos, a "curated" collection of my favorite work. If you’re wondering whether this is a portfolio for five different people: nope!! It’s just me. I've spent the past 30 years obsessively honing creative skills, the result is partially what you see here. The rest, probably good stuff, lies ripped up and in a bin somwehere.</p>

            <p>My background spans writing, producing, directing, and editing—sometimes all at once. I like (and yearn) to be involved from idea to final cut, shaping projects holistically rather than in pieces.</p>

            <p>On the side, I also illustrate and animate to scratch other creative itches. And when I’m not doing that (I am relentless) I’m usually sketching, painting, or patting a cat. Perhaps even two cats, on a good day. Or a puppy, on a very very good day.</p>
