        <div class="content-text">
            <p>I’m a half-Swiss, half-Aussie artist currently based in Switzerland. I find most of my inspiration by the sea.</p>
            <p>I grew up moving to new countries regularly, which pushed me to find my creative voice from an early age. I’m inspired by risk-takers, pioneers, and nature.</p>
            <p>My roots are in traditional paint, illustration, and airbrushing. Professionally, I work as a writer, producer, director, and editor, shaping creative direction from storyboard to final post-production.</p>
