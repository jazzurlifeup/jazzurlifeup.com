        </div>

        <div class="content-text">
            <p>I’m a half-Swiss, half-Aussie (Australia, not Austria) artist currently based in Switzerland. I find most of my inspiration by the sea. </p>
                
            <p>I grew up having the carpet pulled out from under me regularly, my parents themselves creatives that moved us to a new country every two years or so. Whilst the lack of stability was not ideal, it pushed me to explore, experiment, and find my creative voice from an early age onwards.
                </p> I’m inspired by risk-takers, pioneers and nature. I love people who look at a norm and decide to challenge it just to see what happens. My personal style is high contrast - a collection of what I like, feel and see, and always has a story hidden somewhere between the lines. Sometimes on them too.</p>
            
            <p>My roots are in traditional paint, illustration, airbrushing, and writing, from which I grew into what I now focus on professionally. I've worked a writer, producer, director, and editor in branded content, promo videos, short films, and documentaries. My passion lies in shaping the creative direction from the storyboard to the final post-production polish.</p>
