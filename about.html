            <p>I’m a half-Swiss, half-Aussie (Australia, not Austria) artist currently based in Bern, Switzerland. I find most of my inspiration by the sea. I grew up having the carpet pulled out from under me regularly, my parents themselves creatives that moved us to a new country every two years or so. Whilst the lack of stability was challenging, it pushed me to explore, experiment, and find my creative voice from an early age onwards.</p>

            <p>I’m inspired by risk-takers, pioneers and nature. I love it when people challenge norms. My personal style is high contrast - a combination of what I like, feel and see. There's always has a story hidden somewhere between the lines. Sometimes on them too.</p>
            
            <p>My roots are in traditional paint, illustration, airbrushing, and writing. In recent years, I've focused on producing, directing, and editing in branded content, promo videos, short films, and documentaries.</p>
