                        <p>I’m a Swiss-Australian artist based in Bern, Switzerland. I specialise in creative conceptualisation and storytelling.</p>
                        <p>Growing up in a creative environment shaped me into who I am today, as I was constantly encouraged to explore and experiment with art. I’m inspired by people who take risks and challenge norms—qualities that also define my personal creative approach. Influenced by underground comics, surrealism, retro-futurism, and underground counterculture, my personal style is characterised by a bold, unapologetic and story-driven edge.</p>
                        <p>While I have a background in traditional paint mediums, illustration, and airbrushing, I primarily work digitally across various media. I've taken on key roles across various creative projects, from film and music video productions to event organisation. My primary areas of competence lie in creative direction, screenwriting, graphic design, illustration, 2D-animation, post-production, and web design.</p>
